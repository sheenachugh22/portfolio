    <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>

    <p class="body-paragraph">
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the <span class="recipient-placeholder">[Position Title]</span> role at <span class="recipient-placeholder">[Company Name]</span>. With over 9 years of progressive experience in project and program management across cloud infrastructure, MSP software, and enterprise applications, I am confident in my ability to drive successful project outcomes and deliver measurable value to your organization.
    </p>

    <p class="body-paragraph">
        Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a proven ability to lead cross-functional teams, manage complex stakeholder relationships, and deliver projects on time and within budget. What sets me apart is my deep expertise in <strong>Jira administration and process automation</strong>—I don't just manage projects, I optimize how teams work by building dashboards, automating workflows, and implementing scalable processes that drive efficiency and visibility.
    </p>

    <p class="body-paragraph">

This combination of strategic project leadership and technical capability allows me to bridge the gap between business objectives and technical execution.
